Tic Tac Toe Game:
I created this Tic-Tac-Toe game through the terminal.
To play the game, each player must select an index to play their move.
The index selected must be emtpty to be a valid move.
The first player to match three symbols diagonally, vertically or horizontally wins.

Enjoy ðŸ˜ƒ
